# testtask
I took the ready froject from github (https://github.com/urakaiketsuya/docker-laravel-vue)
I changed for laravel  ports:  - "9000:9000" in file https://github.com/karachko/testtask/blob/main/laravel/docker-compose.yml
I changed file https://github.com/karachko/testtask/blob/main/laravel/nginx/default.conf
 Into the laravel folder I executed docker-compose up
